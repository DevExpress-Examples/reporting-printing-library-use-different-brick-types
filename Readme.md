# How to: Use Bricks of Different Types

The following example demonstrates how to use bricks of different types to display different kinds of information in a report.

## Implementation Details

First, drop a simple button onto a form and handle its `Click` event. In the event handler, create a new `PrintingSystem` class instance. Then, create a new `Link` object and add it to the printing system's `Links` collection. Subscribe to the link's `CreateDetailArea` and `CreateMarginalHeaderArea` events to customize a document's detail and marginal header sections, respectively. Finally, create a document and show it in the print preview by calling the `ShowPreview` method.

In the `CreateDetailArea` event handler, use the `ImageBrick` object to display the picture of a fish and the `TextBrick` object to show text containing species characteristics and descriptions. The code also adds a `CheckBoxBrick` to the document and uses a simple `Brick` to draw borders around specific bricks.

The `CreateMarginalHeaderArea` event handler uses the `PageImageBrick` and `PageInfoBrick` objects to show additional information in the page header. The `PageImageBrick` displays the DevExpress logo at the top of every page, while two `PageInfo` bricks display either the current date and time or the page number, depending on the `PageInfo` property value.
